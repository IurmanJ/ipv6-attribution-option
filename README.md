# IPv6 Attribution Option

Implementation of the IPv6 Attribution Option ([draft-herbert-6man-eh-attrib-03](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-herbert-6man-eh-attrib-03)) as a kernel v5.9 patch.

It was made during the IETF 109 Hackathon for the [IPv6 IOAM project](https://github.com/IETF-Hackathon/ietf109-project-presentations/blob/master/IPv6-IOAM.pdf).

Note: the implementation covers the Hop-by-Hop Option part only (not the Destination Option).
